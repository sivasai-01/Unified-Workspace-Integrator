# Unified-Workspace-Integrator
This project is a multi-integration platform that allows users to connect their accounts from **Notion**, **Airtable**, and **HubSpot** using OAuth 2.0. After connecting, users can load and view items (contacts, tables, pages, etc.) from these services in a unified frontend.
